<h3>BBCode</h3>
<p>We are planning on phasing out BBCode as it confuses people and can break page layouts. Instead we will be improving the ways you can enhance your posts with links, images and other embeds. For now the old BBCode styles will continue to work, but please look at some of the other options below before typing in codes.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p>To post a link to a site, just drop the URL in the page and it will be automatically activated.</p>
