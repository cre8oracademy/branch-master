<img src="{{STATIC_URL}}bank/jimmy_gold_elite.jpg" alt="" style="padding: 10px; float: right;" />

<p class="large">The Elite are the solid gold, beating heart of the fuk community. In exchange for a modest annual subscription, you can join them and benefit from a load of privileges which currently include:</p>

<p class="large">
- Classifieds. Being able to list stuff for sale in the <a href="{% url sb_category 'classifieds' %}">classifieds section</a> of our forum.<br>
- Access to the GJ only section of the site, where all sorts of knowledge is dropped on bargains, sales and discount codes.
<br />
- Blags. Exclusive competitions and treats, whenever we have them available.</p>

<p class="large">You also get a little GJ tag,  <img src="{{STATIC_URL}}bank/jimmy_av.gif" align="absmiddle" />, alongside your avatar to show the world you're special.</p>

<p class="large">The 'Jimmy' reference is to Jimmy Hill. (Explanation <a href="/threads/fuk_mannerisms/">here</a>).</p>

<p class="large">NB. Rules are the same for the elite as for regular users - <a href="/help">check in the help section here</a>. You can still be banned and your subscription payment will not be refunded.
